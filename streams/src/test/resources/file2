Unblinking, rather like a
great porcelain idol, U Po Kyin gazed out
into the fierce sunlight.
He was a man of fifty, so fat that for
years he had not risen from
his chair without help, and yet shapely
and even beautiful in his
grossness; for the Burmese do not sag and
bulge like white men, but
grow fat symmetrically, like fruits
swelling.  His face was
vast, yellow and quite unwrinkled, and his
eyes were tawny.  His
feet--squat, high-arched feet with the toes
all the same length--were bare, and so was his cropped head, and he
wore one of those vivid
Arakanese longyis with green and magenta
checks which the Burmese
wear on informal occasions.  He was
chewing betel from a lacquered box on the table, and thinking about
his past life.
