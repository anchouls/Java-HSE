Dorothy filled the bath as
slowly as possible--the splashing always
woke her father if she
turned on the tap too fast--and stood for a
moment regarding the pale,
unappetizing pool of water.  Her body
had gone goose-flesh all over.  She detested cold baths; it was for
that very reason that she
made it a rule to take all her baths cold
from April to November.
Putting a tentative hand into the water--
and it was horribly cold--she drove herself forward with her usual
exhortations.  Come on, Dorothy!  In you go!  No funking, please!
Then she stepped resolutely
into the bath, sat down and let the icy
girdle of water slide up her
body and immerse her all except her
hair, which she had twisted
up behind her head.  The next moment
she came to the surface
gasping and wriggling, and had no sooner
got her breath back than
she remembered her 'memo list', which she
had brought down in her
dressing-gown pocket and intended to read.
She reached out for it,
and, leaning over the side of the bath,
waist deep in icy water,
read through the 'memo list' by the light
of the candle on the chair.
