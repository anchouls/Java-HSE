Mr. Jones, of the Manor Farm,
 had locked the hen-houses for the night, but
was too drunk to remember
 to shut the pop-holes. With the ring of light
from his lantern dancing from
 side to side, he lurched across the yard,
kicked off his boots at the
 back door, drew himself a last glass of beer
from the barrel in the
scullery, and made his
way up to bed, where
Mrs. Jones was already
snoring.
